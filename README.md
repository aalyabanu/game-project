# Text Adventure Game

## Task

The aim of this project is to create a text based adventure game using Object Oriented Programming techniques in JavaScript

## Requirements
- A Single HTML page. The user should not move from the page when playing the game.
- The ability to move around the game to differente "rooms".
- The display of a description of the room when the adventurer enters the room.
- The display of a description of any objects or characters who are in the room.
- The ability to interact with characters and/or objects/rooms in the game (eg. fight a character, solve a puzzle, collect an object).
- The ability to "loose" the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a character, object or room).
- The ability to "win" the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a character, object or room).

## Summary of Tech Stack
Working on this project has helped me understand why classes and objects can sometimes be useful. The use of OOP technique has allowed me to break down the entire adventure game into bite-sized problems and then solve each of these problems one object at time, eventually building upto entire the game. 

## Functionality
This is a basic setup of the game that fulfills all the requirements listed above. The clean and simple interface replicates the monochromatic displays of the 80â€™s text adventure games. In future versions of this game I will attempt to expand on the story and some new forms of user interaction to make the user experience more dynamic and enjoyable.
